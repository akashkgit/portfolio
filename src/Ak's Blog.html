But, any company replicating the existing product/styles is said to go from 1 to n. These 1 to n stages are termed as Globalisation. The 0 to 1 stage is called as Technology/advancement. For example, Amazon was found in 1994. Flipkart was found in 2007. Here, Flipkart has just made a globalisation of online store which was already started in the states. Similarly, Zomato was founded in 2008 and led to a food delivery mania which is still going on and have led lot of company to like uber(uber eats),food panda et cetera.</p><p class="j">When a company goes from 0 to 1, there comes a monoploy. When a company goes from 1 to n, there comes competition. While competition is considered healthy, in here it can start jeopardizing the company's good.Monopoly drives a nation;s economy. But, competition is a struggle of survival. It has got no unique features that can sell their product and thus relies on extreme marketing and sales.Monopoly drives nation. A monopoly company potrays itself as in competition to avoid gaining audit and assessment. Whereas, a Non-Monopoly company claims itself as a monopoly to make a selling point.</p><p class="j">Economic bubble is the bubble pattern in economy of a nation. The economy goes way high and breaks abruptly. Similarly, when internet got famous, most of the company who went on internet got huge funds from ivestors in 1990. But, aftersome time, all those companies who got online faded away.</p><p class="j">one can be optimistic/pessimistic. But both of these are further classfied to definite/indefinite. A definite pessimistic person, knows why he is pessimistic and the bad things thats gonn a happen in future. A indefinite pessimistic person has no clue as to why he is being pessimistic. An Indefinite Optimistic person believes that future will be good without doing anything. A definite optimistic person does things that will make him better in future and believes in it</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
